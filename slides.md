---

Contextual Ambidexterity (part1): 
- Individuals make choices between either the exploitation-oriented or the exploration-oriented activities in their daily work
- Being flexible is necessary: 
  - To allow employees to use their own judgment 
  - They can divide their time between their adaptation-oriented and alignment-oriented activities 

---

Contextual Ambidexterity (part2): 

- Simultaneous pursuing of explorative and explorable measures within a single business unit 
  - Built on processes that encourage individuals to divide their time between activities 
  - They provide value to current customers and seek opportunities and respond to continuous change 

---

Structural Ambidexterity:
  
- Creation of separate organizations or structures for different types of activities
‚Üí Organizations that are either solely aligned or solely adaptive
- Firm separates the explorative from the exploitative unit, each with different management, processes, structures, and cultures, but are well integrated under a senior management team

- Nowadays: company should be able to manage both, innovation and efficiency 
- Reality: organisations face diverse competitive markets & they vary in the required rates of exploration and exploitation
