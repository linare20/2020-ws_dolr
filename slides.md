2 Forms of Organisational Ambidexterity: 

1. Contextual Ambidexterity 
2. Structural Ambidexterity

Contextual Ambidexterity (part1):

  - to allow employees to use their own judgment 
  - they can divide their time between their adaptation-oriented and alignment-oriented activities 

---

Contextual Ambidexterity (part2): 

- Simultaneous pursuing of explorative and explorable measures within a single business unit 
  - uilt on processes that encourage individuals to divide their time between activities 
  - they provide value to current customers and seek opportunities and respond to continuous change 

---

- Creation of separate organizations or structures for different types of activities
‚Üí Organizations that are either solely aligned or solely adaptive
- firm separates the explorative from the exploitative unit, each with different management, processes, structures, and cultures, but are well integrated under a senior management team

- original: it is about developing the necessary capabilities to compete in new markets and cope with technologies (ambidexterity as a capability)
- nowadays: company should be able to manage both, innovation and efficiency 
- reality: organisations face diverse competitive markets & they vary in the required rates of exploration and exploitation
